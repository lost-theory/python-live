# Learn Python Live

This is the repository for Learn Python Live, an accelerated, interactive class teaching Python.

The majority of this material comes from "A Byte of Python", an open source book that teaches programming using the Python language. It was created by [Swaroop C H](http://www.swaroopch.com/) and is available [here](http://python.swaroopch.com/). All credit goes to Swaroop for creating such a great resource for learning Python.

The forked "A Byte of Python" material has the following changes for use in a class setting:

* Python 3 -> Python 2.
* Cut some beginning chapters and appendices to give us just the essential information about learning the language.
* Removed files related to the publishing of the book (book.json, etc.).
* Put Ch. 11 (Data Structures) ahead of Ch. 10 (Modules) so we can write a program using simple values, conditions, loops, functions, and lists/dicts without needing to learn about modules yet. Ch. 10 (Modules) will then be our stepping stone to the standard library and writing larger programs.
* Put Ch. 14 (IO using files) ahead of Ch. 13 (OOP) so we can teach files first and then teach OOP on its own as a larger subject.
* Some small edits and paring down of chapter content to make it easier to teach interactively.
* Removed example programs (they are available in the original repo [here](https://github.com/swaroopch/byte-of-python/tree/master/programs)).
