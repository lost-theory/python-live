## Installing open source modules

Python's built-in functionality and standard library is great, but there's an even larger library of modules in the open source community. Python is used in many fields: web apps, science, data analysis, machine learning, embedded programming, network programming, GUI / desktop applications, automation, etc. By installing new packages from Python's open source community you can tap into these fields and be way more productive than if you were building everything yourself from scratch.
